What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:
- Jira flow, git flow was followed correctly to a certain extent 
- Online and in person meetings were often and productive
- Completing your work on time 

What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint:
- Pull requests had unnecessary conflicts that reviewer had to spend time resolving  
- Use jira better, move task to in progress, and complete when needed, need to follow burndown chart trend more closely  
- Make a format for commit messages

What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:
- Using our own commit message format 
- Creating big subtasks (break them down further)
- Not making subtasks when working on side tasks  

What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1:
- Worst experience- putting off conversations that needed to be done earlier in the sprint, it blocked people from doing their work and ultimately we were not able to reach the end goal we had in mind for the sprint 
- Best experience- the user stories were written well so it was clear what you needed to implement
