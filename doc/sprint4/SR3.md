Jira flow, git flow was followed correctly to a certain extent
Online and in person meetings were often and productive
Completing your work on time
Pull requests should be clean with minimal conflicts
Use jira better, move task to in progress, and complete when needed
Continue with good commit messages
Need to follow burndown chart trend more closely

What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint:
Ensuring user stories have COS

What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:

Creating big subtasks (break them down further)
Only pull in enough tasks in the sprint that can be completed rather than going overboard

What was your best/worst experience during sprint 3:

Worst experience- there was some lack of communition due to which some tasks were not completed and there was a lot of clean up invloved
Best experience- the user stories were written well so it was clear what you needed to implement, the UI looks very good and looks appealing to the eyes, whatever tickets were completed followed COS and can be marked of as complete.
