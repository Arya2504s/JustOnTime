# Project Objective

Build a central web application where consumers can bid on experiences and/or event tickets
last minute such as sporting events, concerts and reservations. The application recommends
events taking place nearby based on the user’s location and also allows users to directly search
for any events.

# Key Personas

- Alex Katz is a 21 year old student at Toronto Metropolitan University, who is trying to
    become a social media influencer and loves to go to events in Toronto to post on
    Instagram. They are also a bit of a mess. Their schedule is always changing and they
    aren’t good at planning things in advance.
- Grace Malcom is a 30- something ambitious woman working for a company that hosts
    events for important business owners and entrepreneurs. She takes her job very
    seriously and is always looking for new ways to promote the events her company puts
    on.

# Key Scenarios

- Alex has just finished his midterm exams and wants to do something fun with his friends
    on the upcoming weekend. Since he was busy studying for his midterms he hasn’t put
    any thought into where to take his friends, and with the weekend being only 2 days
    away, he has to find something fun to do.
- Grace’s company is hosting a wine and cheese tasting event and she is in charge of the
    table reservations. She is told by her boss to find the most important - and highest
    paying - customers as there is a very limited number of tables.

# Key Principles

- Speed and convenience over transparency: The design of event pages should show
    only the most important details rather than a complete description of the event. The
    design should generate a sense of urgency and demand.
- Reliability over customer convenience: All bids placed on the application are final and
    cannot be canceled. Payment is required at the time of placing a bid.
