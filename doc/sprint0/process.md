**Decision Making:**
Decisions are made through unanimous vote, everyone has to agree on decisions being
made, otherwise we have a discussion where we either try to come up with a compromise
and if that's not possible then persuade anyone opposing the decision to agree.

**Prioritizing User Stories:**
Everyone assigns a reasonable point to the user story, this first vote will show how much
disparity there is among the estimates. The group discusses the range, asking the outlying
voters to describe their reasoning process, this is repeated until everyone produces the
same estimate.

**Meetings:**
Meetings happen on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, for all planned meetings everyone
says what they’ve done, what they will work on and what they need from the team. Then if
there are any decisions that need to be made we can make them during the meeting and if
anyone has questions they can ask them at the end of the meeting. Then since we’re all
gathered if anyone needs to work with someone else they can stay back and work together.
If everyone decides to have an impromptu meeting then there is no preparation required. If a
member of the team has called the meeting they are expected to have made preparations
and run the meeting.

**Next Phase:**
We should try and be more clear about dividing the work and make sure everyone has an
even amount to do and make sure everyone agrees that the work is divided evenly. We will
also try to work on things relevant to the scope of this sprint. We sometimes got ahead of
ourselves and lost sight of what needed to be done by the end of this sprint.
