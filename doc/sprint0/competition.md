A marketplace for last minute sports, music and shows tickets.

- While GameTime focuses on tickets for sports and music events, JustOnTime places its
    focus on last minute experiences. GameTime’s target market is generally consumers
    who are looking to get tickets for a specific event they have in mind, such as a concert
    from their favorite artist or tickets to their favorite basketball team. JustOnTime places its
    focus on consumers who are looking for something to do at the last minute but don’t
    have anything particular in mind.
- GameTime provides tickets at a fixed price that is determined by the ticket seller (the
    original provider) while JustOnTime utilizes a bidding system to allow consumers to
    “compete” against one another for the experience. This allows consumers to pay for
    experiences/tickets based on their demand rather than a value set by the event
    organizer.
- In order for GameTime to focus on these scenarios they would require to change their
    entire business model and application as currently they do not utilize a bidding system
    and sell all tickets at a fixed price, and only offer a limited variety of event types.

A marketplace for all kinds of experiences

- Despite the name, LastMinute focuses on experiences of all kinds that consumers can
    purchase at a fixed price. The target market is consumers who do not know what kind of
    experience they’re looking for, or consumers who are looking to purchase a gift for
    someone else.
- LastMinute provides experiences at a fixed price that is determined by the original
    provider while JustOnTime utilizes a bidding system to allow consumers to “compete”
    against one another for the experience. This allows consumers to pay for
    experiences/tickets based on their demand rather than a value set by the event
    organizer.
- LastMinute is in a good position to focus these scenarios as they would only require to
    introduce a bidding system, however, this would require a significant change in their
    business model.
