# Release Planning Meeting (2022-06-10)

## Release Goals:
* Our goal is to release an app that provides consumers with a chance to book experiences last minute by bidding against other users. 
From sporting events, concert tickets, restaurant reservations, and everything in between. Whether you forgot to buy tickets for you and 
your significant other, or need a last minute reservation for a friends birthday party, you are never late, always just on time.

* We want to complete all of our sprint tasks, minimize all bugs and prepare the project visually.

* Finalize different functionalities and accesses for different users (customer and event organizer)
